Cluster certificates
====================

Certificates expiration in cluster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If certificate is expired for DNS name(for example `heedbookslave.northeurope.cloudapp.azure.com`)
        
#. Copy DNS name (<heedbookslave.northeurope.cloudapp.azure.com>). 
#. Rename DNS name to any another (for example `heedbookslave2.northeurope.cloudapp.azure.com`).
#. Create new VM outside the cluster (let's call it `dns-vm`).
#. For new VM (`dns-vm`) create new DNS name equals copied DNS name (`heedbookslave.northeurope.cloudapp.azure.com`).
#. Run the following commands in new virtual machine(`dns-vm`).

.. code:: console

        $ sudo apt update
        $ sudo apt install certbot
        $ sudo certbot certonly --standalone --preferred-challenges http -d heedbookslave.northeurope.cloudapp.azure.com
             
When running the command, you will be prompted to enter an email address and agree to the terms of service. After doing so, you should see a message telling you the process was successful and where your certificates are stored:

.. code:: console

        Output
        IMPORTANT NOTES:
        - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
        /etc/letsencrypt/live/heedbookslave.northeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/fullchain.pem
        Your key file has been saved at:
        /etc/letsencrypt/live/heedbookslave.northeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/privkey.pem
        Your cert will expire on 2018-10-09. To obtain a new or tweaked
        version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot
        again. To non-interactively renew *all* of your certificates, run
        "certbot renew"
        - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
        configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
        secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
        also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
        making regular backups of this folder is ideal.

Copy files 

- ``/etc/letsencrypt/live/heedbookslave.northeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/fullchain.pem``
- ``/etc/letsencrypt/live/heedbookslave.northeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/privkey.pem``

to master node to directory ``/home/heeadbookadmin/source/hb-infrastructure/Certificates`` and rename it using format ``filename_YYYYmmDD.pem``. 

Run following command in VM master node

.. code:: console

        $ kubectl delete secret tls-secret
        $ kubectl create secret tls tls-secret --key privkey_YYYYmmDD.pem --cert fullchain_YYYYmmDD.pem
